### Enable the dot files

to .bashrc, .zshrc & zsh theme
```sh
cd <path_to_local_repo>
```

```sh
chmod u+x ./dot-files/enable.sh
```

```sh
./dot-files/enable.sh
```

### Update the dot files
Run the update.sh to update the dotfiles into ~/bin/dotfiles & create link files
to .bashrc, .zshrc & zsh theme
```sh
cd <path_to_local_repo>
```

```sh
chmod u+x ./dot-files/update.sh
```

```sh
./dot-files/update.sh
```

```sh
update_rcs
```

### Your private aliases
On the folder `~/bin/dotfiles/common`, you will find the `private-aliases` file wich you may store your own private aliases

### Overwrite the bashrc or zshrc
You can create the file `~/.bashrc.local` or `~/.zshrc.local` to overwrite some configs if your are using `Bash` or `Zsh`

### Overwrite the PATH system variable
You can create the file `~/.bashrc.path` or `~/.zshrc.path` to overwrite the PATH variable if you are using `Bash` or `Zsh`
This is useful if you need some versions of `Ruby` or other things, to be included on the Shell.

The content of the file must look like this:
```sh
export PATH="<paths_to_add_separated_by_:>:$PATH"
```

## Sublime text files
